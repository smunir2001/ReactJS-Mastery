## Section 2 - React Basics
### Introduction
Creating React apps can involve a lot of files and time. Therefore, Facebook released a tool called __Create-React-App__.
* Scaffold a basic ReactJS application to get started
* Use npx/npm

__package.json__ provides developers with the necessary different libraries and packages that this application requires to work.

The __src__ folder is the entry point to the code for our React application.

The __index.js__ file is the entry point of all React applications.

Whatever is present in __App__ will be rendered to the __root div__ in __index.html__.

### Components
A component is a self-contained piece of code that returns some visual UI representation of our app.
* Combination of HTML, CSS, and JS
